I am a 21-year-old medical and generative AI researcher. 

I graduated at 19 years old with a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of California, Davis. I was under the supervision of Dr. Richard Levenson at the UC Davis Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. I was researching the application of deep learning (especially generative AI) to novel microscopy techniques for digital pathology. I have presented my work at several conferences (SPIE Photonics West, ICML workshop, BMES, etc.), published a book chapter, established various collaborations with labs around the world, and more. I have contributed to many open-source projects, including being on the founding team for [DALL-E mini](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini), being a frequent contributor to the [fastai library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). I am also involved in various teaching initiatives, being a teaching assistant for Part 1 and instructor for Part 2 of the [2022 fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai).

I was formerly a Research Director at Stability AI. At the time of my departure, I was the ninth-most senior employee. At Stability AI, I focused on various generative and medical AI research directions, worked with the various groups within Stability AI such as CarperAI, and I formerly served as their social media manager (Twitter and Instagram). I also helped manage the external compute cluster, where I managed our relationships with a variety of external collaborators that we provided compute to in order to progress the field of generative AI.

At Stability AI, I founded and led [MedARC](https://medarc.ai), an open-source medical AI research organization focused on training foundation models for medicine. We published landmark papers in NeurIPS, ICML and Nature Biomedical Engineering, built a community of >3k people interested in medical AI on Discord, and even had our work submitted to a US Senate hearing.

I am active on Twitter, mainly participating in discussions and sharing resources related to machine learning and STEM. I have an awesome audience on Twitter of 70k followers (including luminaries in the field of machine learning like Jeremy Howard, Andrej Karpathy, tech innovators like Marc Andreessen, Garry Tan, and more), with many people finding my content useful. Check out my account [here](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr). Additionally, I have a blog related to machine learning topics. Check it out over [here](https://tanishq.ai/blog). I am also active in several online machine learning communities like fast.ai and EleutherAI.

I used to be active on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/tanlikesmath), where I received 2 silver medals and 2 bronze medals in machine learning competitions, as well as achieving Notebooks Grandmaster and Discussions Master rank. Some of the content and resources I shared have been widely used throughout the machine learning community. One of my code examples/notebooks on Kaggle was used heavily by winners of a Kaggle competition. One dataset I released on Kaggle has been used in several papers, even a Nature Machine Intelligence paper.

I have also been recognized as a child genius and a prodigy. I graduated high school at 10 years old with a 4.0 GPA. At 11 years old, I obtained 3 Associate Degrees also with a 4.0 GPA. At 14 years old, I graduated from UC Davis summa cum laude with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering. For these reasons, I have been recognized on many international and national TV, radio and print news, TV and radio talk shows, reality TV shows and documentary shows, and have been a role model for young and old students around the world.
